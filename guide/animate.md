# Animation Guide: Simple Transfer

## Goal
A clear, prominent visual link between the **Purification Vessel** (Source) and the **Gold Balance** (Destination).

## The Flow

### 1. The Pulse (Already Built)
- The **Gold Bar** pulses and glows. This is our "launch pad".

### 2. The Flight (Projectile)
- **Visual**: A single, large, glowing **Gold Orb** (or a tight cluster).
- **Action**: Launches from the center of the Red Bar.
- **Path**: Flies in a slight arc up to the **Gold Token Balance** (Top Left/Center).
- **Speed**: Fast but readable (~0.6s).

### 3. The Impact (Reward)
- **Trigger**: When the Orb hits the top bar.
- **Visual**: 
    - The Gold Balance **Numbers bump up** (scale up/bounce).
    - A localized **Gold Flash** around the balance area.
